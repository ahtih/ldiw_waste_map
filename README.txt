LDIW Waste Map for Drupal 6.x
-----------------------------
LDIW Waste Map module provides:

- "Waste Point" content type, which has fields such as Geo coordinates,
	photos, amount and composition of waste, etc.
- Waste Map display, displaying the "Waste Point" nodes. This is implemented
	using OpenLayers, WFS, and Geoclustering modules. If you have more than
	ca thousand points, map level of detail will start to change dynamically
	as you zoom in and out in map display. It should scale to over
	100 000 waste points.

The module is intended to be used in http://www.letsdoitworld.org/ project,
and is likely not useful outside of it.

Installation
------------
LDIW Waste Map can be installed like any other Drupal module -- place it
in the modules directory for your site and enable it on the
`admin/build/modules` page. There are a number of dependencies as well
(e.g. OpenLayers) which are pointed out to you when you enable the module.

Many patches to other modules are needed for Waste Map to really work:
- http://drupal.org/files/issues/wfs-filter-changes.patch
- http://drupal.org/files/issues/geo-filter-float.patch
- http://drupal.org/files/issues/geo-ewkb-parsing.patch
- http://drupal.org/node/710908

To see anything on Waste Map, you need to add some content (nodes having
"Waste Point" content type) using the usual Drupal methods
(e.g. on `node/add/waste-point` page).

You can also mass-import ca 10k Waste Points from Estonia's 2008 cleanup;
these are provided in sample_data/prygikohad.csv in CSV format. You can
import them e.g. using Node Import module, but you have to apply
http://drupal.org/files/issues/node_import-707760.patch to get Node Import
to support Geo fields.

After that you should see the map at http://{your-drupal-root-URL}/waste_map
